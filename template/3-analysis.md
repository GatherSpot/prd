# Analysis of the Situation
## Importance of GatherSpot
Nowadays, on EPFL campus, there are many flyers to advertise events and gatherings. They are all over the place and make it hard for students to remember the dates they are interested in, etc. This traditional method is not always seen by the target audience, and although the current PocketCampus app has an event tab, it is just a barebone list, it has no inscription features, no calendar integration, etc.

GatherSpot is designed to address these common challenges faced by people when it comes to organizing and participating in events. By providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform, GatherSpot simplifies and enhances the event management process, making it beneficial for both casual users and organizers. 

Here is an analysis of why such an app would be useful and the problems it aims to solve:

- Fragmented communication and difficult spreading of information

    - Individuals: People often use multiple platforms (social media, email, messaging apps) to organize and discuss events. This can lead to fragmented communication and important details being overlooked.
    
    - Organizers: Universities, clubs, and organizations face even more complexity, with communication spread across various channels and platforms. This can lead to inefficiencies and miscommunications.

    Our app centralizes everything from event search with filtering based on location or interests, to registration and communication with other participants.

- Inefficient Attendance Management:

    - Individuals: For smaller gatherings, manually tracking attendance can be cumbersome and prone to errors.

    - Large-Scale Organizers: Managing attendance for large events involves complex logistics, such as ticketing, capacity planning, and    
    attendee verification.
   
   Our app offers NFC technology to check attendance which is a way to prove one's identity.

- Lack of Post-Event Feedback:

    - Individuals: Gathering feedback from attendees informally can result in limited insights and missed opportunities for improvement.

    - Organizers: Structured post-event feedback is crucial for continuous improvement but is often difficult to collect and analyze effectively.

    Our app offers the possibility to rate events for attendees such that organizers can improve based on the feedback.

Several apps and platforms offer features similar to GatherSpot, each catering to various aspects of event organization and participation. 

Here are 2 of the key competitors:

- Eventbrite: Features include event creation, promotion, ticket sales, and attendee management. Strengths include strong brand recognition, robust ticketing and payment processing and comprehensive event analytics.

- Meetup: Features include event creation, group formation, interest-based event discovery, RSVPs. Strengths include a large and active community.

Eventbrite offers a significant feature not available in GatherSport: an integrated ticketing and payment processing system. This is especially important when it comes to event organizers who can set up ticket sales directly within the platform, eliminating the need for third-party services.

Complementary products for our app that would enhance the app's functionality and user experience include the following:

- Social Media platforms like Facebook, Twitter/X, and Instagram can complement GatherSpot by allowing users to share event details with their accounts, increasing event visibility and attendance.

- Payment platforms like PayPal or Ticketmaster can offer payment options for events during registration.
