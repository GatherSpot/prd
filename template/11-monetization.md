# Business Model

*Expected operating Costs*

The operating costs for the event application will include development and ongoing maintenance expenses, such as the initial development costs and continuous improvement of the app's features. Infrastructure costs will involve expenses for Firebase services, cloud hosting, and CDN services, as well as the necessary code maintenance to keep APIs functional and compatible over time. Operational costs will cover salaries for customer support staff, general administrative expenses, and compensation for the development team, marketing team, and administrative staff. Additionally, marketing and sales expenditures will encompass advertising campaigns, partnership formation and maintenance, and public relations efforts.

*Revenue Streams*

The event application will generate revenue through a combination of commissions on registration fees, advertising, and sponsorships. Commissions will be earned on ticket sales or registration fees processed through the app. Advertising revenue will come from displaying in-app ads and partnering with brands to promote sponsored events and activities. Sponsorships will provide additional revenue, with brands and businesses sponsoring events or featuring prominently on the app through sponsorship packages that include banner ads, featured listings, and co-branded content.
