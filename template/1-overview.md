GatherSpot is the all-in one mobile app for organizing and discovering social events that match your interests. With features for event creation and browsing, communication, attendance control, and post-event feedback, it's an all-in-one solution for both organizers and participants. 

The app offers comprehensive functionalities to manage the entire lifecycle of eventsâ€” from creation and promotion to participation and post-event feedback. Users can create or register to events they like, communicate through an integrated chat for each event they participate in, and utilize a follower-following mechanism. Organizers can also control event attendance and see the event rating after its end. Whether you want to be a casual participant or active organizer, GatherSpot makes managing your social life around events effortless and engaging.

GatherSpot primarily targets individual users who want to improve how they organize and participate in social events.

The goal of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to enhance the user experience by incorporating convenience features.
Additionally, we aspire to make GatherSpot suitable not only for individuals but also for larger entities such as universities, clubs, and organizations. A long-term objective is to make them use the app to inform users of their large-scale upcoming events. To achieve this objective, we will need to update the code such that:

 -  It enables them having their own databases and making them self-hostable. 

 -  It implements more robust authentication methods beyond email addresses and 2FA, to ensure security and reliability (proof someone has the right to access such events from these entities).

 - It allows universities, clubs, and organizations to tailor the app to their specific needs and integrate it seamlessly into their existing systems.

By achieving these goals, GatherSpot will not only serve individual users but also become an essential tool for larger institutions, revolutionizing how social events are organized and attended.
