( Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is a realization of a certain method or idea in order to demonstrate its feasibility, or a demonstration in principle with the aim of verifying that some concept or theory has practical potential. A proof-of-concept is usually small and may or may not be complete.)

GatherSpot is designed to be the all-in one tool for event management and social engagement. By providing a platform that caters to both event organizers and participants, GatherSpot addresses the needs of a wide user base. The app includes the following 6 core features:

- Event Creation: Users can easily create events and customize details

- Event Discovery: Participants can browse events based on their interests, location, and social connections.

- Integrated Communication: Each event has its own chat room, allowing participants and organizers to communicate effectively.

- Attendance Control: Organizers can manage attendance, ensuring that events are well-coordinated and that participant numbers are controlled.

- Post-Event Feedback: After an event, users can rate their experience and provide feedback, helping organizers improve future events.

- Follower-Following System: Users can follow others to stay updated on their activities and events they are interested in.

- Notifications: Once a user is registered for an event, they will receive 3 reminders: one a day before, another 2 hours before and the last one at the beginning.

All features require use to be authenticated.
