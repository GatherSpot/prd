- **Event Creation:**: Users can easily create events and customize details.

- **Event Discovery:** Participants can browse events based on their interests, location, and social connections.

- **Integrated Communication:** Each event has its own chat room, allowing participants and organizers to communicate effectively.

- **Attendance Control:** Organizers can manage attendance, ensuring that events are well-coordinated and that participant numbers are controlled.

- **Post-Event Feedback:** After an event, users can rate their experience and provide feedback, helping organizers improve future events.

- **Follower-Following System:** Users can follow others to stay updated on their activities and events they are interested in.

- **Notifications:** Once a user is registered for an event, they will receive 3 reminders: one a day before, another 2 hours before and the last one at the beginning of the event.

All features require the user to be authenticated.
