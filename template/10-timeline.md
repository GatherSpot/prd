# Timeline

## Execution Roadmap
We decided to define four milestones, that should be of two weeks each, of how we want to developp the mvp.
Each milestone will contain at least one UI element, one backend element, and a documentation element to make it easier to distribute and parallelize the work.

#### Milestone 1
- Make app database agnostic (support both firebase and PostgreSQL)
- Write documentation to deploy easily on firebase Spark plan (any person confortable with a computer should be able to do it)
- First design of the during event screen
- Write clearly to customers what data we collect, how, and why.
- Choose license, and define liability. (needed as we should make sure we are not liable for poorly managed servers)
  
### Milestone 2
- Make a self hostable server using PostgreSQL
- Make a documented docker doplyable by any computer enthousiast
- Add tools for during events : tournament tree, friend finder, group maker, etc.
  
### Milestone 3
- Add an authentification mechanism on the self hostable version (alternative to google Oauth, inside the server)
- Add integrated payment methods
- Design a way to make enrollments to servers simple and quick, add a way to follow a server's events via a link and a screen to see what servers we follow.
- Design a sales plan to sell tailored options to big organisations to increase adoption.
### Milestone 4
- Setup a verified partner program
- Make a hosting plan for non technical customers
- Making a simple static website to advertise and group documentation (more friendly towards non technical people than the github page)

## Development Resources

Due to the hosting plan, we only need to find budget for the developpers, and the current milestones should be reacheable with a team of 3. One UI developper, one backend developper and a person technical enough to help with documentations and able to sell the product to big organisations.

The four milestones should be doable in 12 weeks, but we obviously need some reserves for potential problems.

The later ressources should be paid by partners willing to get more functionality and maintenance of their product.

## Deployment Resources

The only fees is the initial app store fee, and analytics server, but we could use the free tier of google analytics.
For milestone 4, we can start selling hosting by setting up firebase for the customer and taking a small fee, once the buisness grows, we can use the profit to buy our own servers using the postgress version and augment profit margin.

## Maintenance and Upkeep

Each server hosted by us will have a garenteed revenue, as we only host for paying organisers, and don't expect revenue from participants, so server maintenance should not be a concern. Depending on who we partner with, we could go open source to get the community involved, or we can charge for custom functionality and tailored experience for each partner.
