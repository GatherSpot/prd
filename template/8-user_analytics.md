# User Analytics and Acceptance

Since we aim a multi-server self hosted ecosystem, user analytics must come from a opt-in mecanism on the server side which will greatly be out of our control, but we can always gather information from the application side.

## Key metrics
The key metrics are number of events created, number of users, and number of severs joined, and event attendance rates.
Not only are those metrics easy to anonymise, but they are also all collectable from the app, who will mostly if not exclusively be downloaded from the main app stores, meaning we will have full control over them. (Even if we go open source)

## Success criteria
Having, in three months, at least 100 servers running from individuals, 3 partnerships with big organisations (universities, assotiations, buisnesses, of at least a 1000 people), and at least 3'000 active users.
