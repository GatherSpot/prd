# User Analytics and Acceptance

Since we aim at a multi-server self-hosted ecosystem, user analyticss must come from an opt-in mechanism on the server side which will greatly be out of our control, but we can always gather information from the application side.

## Key metrics
The key metrics are the number of events created, the number of users, the number of servers joined, and event attendance rates.
Not only are those metrics easy to anonymise, but they are also collectable from the app, which will mostly, if not exclusively, be downloaded from the main app stores, meaning we will have full control over them (even if we go open source).

## Success criteria
Having, in three months, at least 100 servers running from individuals, 3 partnerships with big organisations (universities, assotiations, buisnesses, of at least a 1000 people), and at least 3'000 active users.
